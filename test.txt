This is a test document about dragons.

Dragons are mythical creatures that appear in folklore worldwide. They are often depicted as large, serpentine creatures with wings and the ability to breathe fire.

In Western cultures, dragons are typically portrayed as winged, horned creatures capable of breathing fire. In Eastern cultures, they are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.

The word "dragon" entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French "dragon", which comes from Latin "draco" meaning "huge serpent, dragon".
