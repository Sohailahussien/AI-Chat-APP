Cubi AI - Core Concept & Architecture

Core Concept: AI-Powered Document Chat

Cubi AI is an intelligent chat application that allows users to have conversations with AI about their uploaded documents. Think of it as having a knowledgeable assistant that can read, understand, and answer questions about your files.



Key Features & Architecture

1. Document Intelligence (RAG System)
File Upload: Supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc` files
Smart Processing: Extracts and processes document content
Context-Aware Responses**: AI answers questions based on uploaded documents
User Isolation: Each user's documents are private and separate

2. Dual AI Capabilities
General AI: Handles everyday questions and conversations
Document-Specific AI: Provides answers based on uploaded content
Smart Routing: Automatically determines which context to use

3. Modern ChatGPT-Style Interface
Minimized Sidebar: Compact navigation (64px width)
Expandable Sidebar: Full navigation with text labels (256px width)
Clean Design: OpenAI-inspired UI with dark/light themes
Responsive Layout: Works on desktop and mobile



User Workflow

Step 1: Upload Documents

User uploads file → System processes content → Stores in user's private space


Step 2: Ask Questions

User asks question → System determines context → AI responds with relevant information


Step 3: Get Intelligent Answers

General questions → General AI knowledge
Document questions → AI + Document context




Technical Foundation

Frontend
Next.js 14: React framework with app router
TypeScript: Type-safe development
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach

Backend
MCP (Model Context Protocol): Custom document processing system
Embedding System: Cohere AI for semantic similarity
User Authentication: JWT-based auth with Prisma ORM
File Processing: Multi-format document support

AI Integration
OpenAI/Anthropic: Primary AI providers
Cohere: Embedding and similarity matching
Fallback Systems: Keyword matching when embeddings fail


Design Philosophy

User Experience
Intuitive: Familiar chat interface like ChatGPT
Efficient: Quick file upload and instant responses
Private: User-specific document storage
Accessible: Clean, readable interface

Visual Identity
Minimalist: Clean, distraction-free design
Professional: Business-ready appearance
Consistent: Unified design language throughout
Modern: Contemporary UI patterns



Value Proposition

For Individual Users
Document Q&A: Ask questions about your files
Content Summarization: Get quick document summaries
Research Assistant: AI helps analyze your documents
Knowledge Extraction: Find specific information quickly

For Businesses
Document Intelligence: AI-powered document analysis
Team Collaboration: Shared document understanding
Knowledge Management: Centralized document insights
Productivity Tool: Faster document processing



Core Innovation

The app's unique value lies in **seamlessly combining general AI conversation with document-specific intelligence. Users can:

1.Chat naturally: about any topic
2.Upload documents: for context
3.Ask specific questions: about their files
4.Get intelligent responses: that blend general knowledge with document content

This creates a unified AI assistant that's both conversational and document-aware, making it a powerful tool for knowledge work and document analysis.
