# Multi-Agent Orchestration Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing strategies for the multi-agent orchestration system to ensure it's working properly in production.

## 🧪 Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

### 2. Integration Testing
Test the orchestration with real scenarios:
```bash
node scripts/test-orchestration.js
```

### 3. Manual Testing
Test specific orchestration features manually.

## 🎯 Key Areas to Test

### A. Chain Management
- ✅ Create new agent chains
- ✅ Retrieve chains by ID
- ✅ Update chain configurations
- ✅ Delete chains
- ✅ List all chains

### B. Execution Types
- ✅ Sequential execution (step-by-step)
- ✅ Parallel execution (concurrent steps)
- ✅ Mixed execution (some parallel, some sequential)

### C. Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful failure handling
- ✅ Retry policies
- ✅ Timeout management
- ✅ Dependency validation

### D. Decision Making
- ✅ Conditional execution paths
- ✅ Dynamic routing based on input
- ✅ Multi-path workflows

### E. Validation
- ✅ Input validation rules
- ✅ Output validation rules
- ✅ Custom validation logic

### F. Audit Trail
- ✅ Complete execution logging
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Error tracking
- ✅ Step-by-step traceability

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```bash
# Run the orchestration demo
npm run demo:orchestration
```

### 2. Performance Test
```bash
# Test with different input sizes
node src/services/agentOrchestrationDemo.ts
```

### 3. Stress Test
```bash
# Test concurrent executions
node scripts/stress-test-orchestration.js
```

## 📊 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Document Processing Pipeline
```
Input → Extract → Analyze → Summarize → Output
```
**Test Steps:**
1. Upload a document
2. Verify extraction step completes
3. Verify analysis step uses extracted data
4. Verify summary step combines all results
5. Check audit trail for all steps

### Scenario 2: Parallel Processing
```
Input → [Sentiment Analysis] → Combine → Output
         [Keyword Extraction]
```
**Test Steps:**
1. Verify both parallel steps start simultaneously
2. Verify combine step waits for both dependencies
3. Check execution time is optimized
4. Verify no race conditions

### Scenario 3: Error Recovery
```
Input → Step1 → Step2(fails) → Step3(continues) → Output
```
**Test Steps:**
1. Verify Step2 failure is logged
2. Verify Step3 continues despite Step2 failure
3. Check error handling policy is respected
4. Verify audit trail shows error details

### Scenario 4: Decision Making
```
Input → Analyze → Decision → [Path A] → Output
                           → [Path B]
```
**Test Steps:**
1. Test with input that triggers Path A
2. Test with input that triggers Path B
3. Verify decision logic is correct
4. Check only one path executes

## 🔍 Monitoring Points

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Should be reasonable for each step
- **Memory Usage**: Should not grow excessively
- **Concurrent Executions**: Should respect max concurrency
- **Error Rate**: Should be below acceptable threshold

### Reliability Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Retry Rate**: How often retries are needed
- **Timeout Rate**: How often timeouts occur
- **Dependency Failures**: How often dependencies fail

### Audit Trail Quality
- **Completeness**: All steps should be logged
- **Accuracy**: Logged data should match actual execution
- **Timing**: Timestamps should be accurate
- **Error Details**: Error information should be comprehensive

## 🛠️ Debugging Tips

### 1. Check Execution Status
```javascript
const status = orchestrator.getExecutionStatus(executionId);
console.log('Execution Status:', status);
```

### 2. Review Audit Trail
```javascript
const auditTrail = orchestrator.getAuditTrail(executionId);
console.log('Audit Trail:', auditTrail);
```

### 3. Monitor Chain Health
```javascript
const chains = orchestrator.listChains();
chains.forEach(chain => {
  console.log(`Chain: ${chain.name}, Steps: ${chain.steps.length}`);
});
```

### 4. Test Individual Steps
```javascript
// Test a single step
const step = chain.steps[0];
const result = await orchestrator.executeStep(step, context);
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Step Dependencies Not Met
**Symptoms:** Execution fails with "Step depends on non-existent step"
**Solution:** Check dependency IDs match exactly

### Issue 2: Parallel Execution Deadlock
**Symptoms:** Execution hangs on parallel steps
**Solution:** Verify dependency graph has no cycles

### Issue 3: Timeout Errors
**Symptoms:** Steps fail with timeout errors
**Solution:** Increase timeout values or optimize step performance

### Issue 4: Memory Leaks
**Symptoms:** Memory usage grows over time
**Solution:** Ensure proper cleanup of execution contexts

### Issue 5: Audit Trail Missing
**Symptoms:** No audit entries for executions
**Solution:** Verify auditTrail is enabled in workflow config

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Simple Chain**: < 5 seconds
- **Parallel Chain**: < 3 seconds
- **Complex Chain**: < 30 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB per execution
- **Concurrent Executions**: Up to 10 simultaneous

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test with 100 concurrent executions
node scripts/load-test.js --concurrent=100 --duration=60
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

The orchestration system is working properly when:

1. ✅ All test scenarios pass
2. ✅ Performance meets benchmarks
3. ✅ Error handling works correctly
4. ✅ Audit trail is complete and accurate
5. ✅ No memory leaks detected
6. ✅ Concurrent executions work properly
7. ✅ Decision making logic is correct
8. ✅ Validation rules are enforced
