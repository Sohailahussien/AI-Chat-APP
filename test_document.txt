# Multi-Agent Orchestration System

## Overview
This document describes a comprehensive multi-agent orchestration system designed for production-grade GenAI applications.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processing Agents
- **Document Retriever**: Loads and parses documents from various sources
- **Document Analyzer**: Analyzes document structure, topics, and complexity
- **Text Processor**: Cleans and prepares text for analysis

### 2. Content Processing Agents
- **Vectorizer**: Converts text to vector embeddings
- **Content Organizer**: Structures content for optimal presentation

### 3. Analysis and Generation Agents
- **Summarizer**: Creates concise summaries
- **Response Generator**: Generates coherent responses

### 4. Validation and Quality Agents
- **Response Validator**: Validates response quality and accuracy
- **Quality Controller**: Makes final delivery decisions

### 5. Planning and Coordination Agents
- **Task Planner**: Plans multi-step workflows
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Executes planned workflows

## Workflow Patterns

### Document Analysis Pattern
1. Document Retriever loads the document
2. Document Analyzer analyzes structure and topics
3. Text Processor cleans and chunks the content
4. Summarizer creates a summary
5. Content Organizer structures the information

### Query Response Pattern
1. Retrieval Agent finds relevant content
2. Response Generator creates a response
3. Response Validator checks quality
4. Quality Controller makes delivery decision

### Full Pipeline Pattern
1. Task Planner creates execution plan
2. Document processing agents handle input
3. Vectorizer creates embeddings
4. Retrieval Agent finds relevant content
5. Response Generator creates response
6. Validation agents ensure quality
7. Quality Controller delivers final result
